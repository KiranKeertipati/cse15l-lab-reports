# Lab Report 4 #
For this lab we had to track steps 4 to 9 from the Week 7 lab and note down all the commands we used to do the tasks. The following are the steps:
### 4. Loging into ieng6 : #
To log in to my ieng6 account, I first opened a terminal and typed the following code: `ssh cs15lsp23nt@ucsd.edu`. I was then prompted to enter my password, which I did, then I pressed `<enter>` and I entered my account. The following was the results of the above steps:

### 5. Cloning the fork of the repository from your Github account #
To clone the Github repository I did the following steps:
I first copied this block of code using `<command>` and `<c>` together `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7` and then pasted it onto my terminal using `<command>` and `<v>` together. This step copied and pasted that block of code onto my terminal. Then I pressed `<enter>`. This step cloned the github repository onto my ieng6 account.

### 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail #
To do this step, I 
### 7. Edit the code file ListExamples.java to fix the failing test (as a reminder, the error in the code is just that index1 is used instead of index2 in the final loop in merge)#
### 8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed #
### 9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account #
